		<div class="stack section_1">Hi there! My name is Marilyn Silva and I have always had a love for creating.
My mom is a very creative person and passed the love of creating different
types of art down to me.
<br>
<br>
I started with craft-type creations and while I still enjoy these types of crafts,
I have moved more into the design world.
<br>
<br>
I am currently in school working towards earning my degree in Digital Media
and am enjoying using the new skills acquired to create different types of art.
<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy my work! I am always open to creating custom designs so
just send me a message with what you want and I'll make it happen for you!</div>
